Solved the problem and there seems to be two solutions on this Day 4.
My solution is 210, but when I run another persons code with the same input I get the answer 208, which should be right.

What makes my solution wrong (and shared with another person on the site) can be that my solution does not take mispelled passes
into account and my theory is that two of them can actually be misspelled. Also dependent on the program used to generate the right solution
in the first place one must also think if the missing delimiter at EOF is taken into account or not.

In short there may be one or two misspelled passes in the input data and one could argue if they would count as valid or not.

Extra assignment will be to make a program that check for spelling errors also.

One thing to think of when you make a program that scan all parts of the file for the keywords is that the combination of letters could 
make a false keyword appearing in the hexcode for hair color.

Since stringtesting will be the crucial part in the next version of the program I will likely make it in another language.
If I still want to go with C I will opt for a regexp solution.

If I go with regexp solution I can let the program output the keywords to a file and after that use the regexp to read. That is if one
can't use regexp to read directly from array to output.
